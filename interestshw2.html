                    <h1>Interests</h1>
                    For the most part, in my spare time I like to either listen to music or play video games. At any time of 
the day, I am listening to music whenever I can, even when I'm asleep. I usually listen to rap music but I 
am always open to any genre and any new recommendations. Some of my favorite artists are JPEGMAFIA, JID, 
Death Grips, Denzel Curry, Kendrick Lamar, The Marias, and many others. I also enjoy playing video games with my friends 
in my spare time. Some of my favorite games are Dead by Daylight, Rainbow 6 Siege, and Fortnite.
                    Below are some of my favorite albums as of right now:
