                        My name is Jaime Perez. I'm 19 years old and I'm am a junior at the City College of New 
                        York majoring in Computer Science and in the future my goal is to be a software engineer 
                        or work in cybersecurity. I've always had an interest in computers and technology so choosing 
                        computer science was an easy decision for me when it was time for college. I live in Queens 
                        and have lived here my entire life.
